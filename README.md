# What We Built? 🎉

## In 30 Seconds

We made an **interactive website** that teaches the **"Handshaking Lemma"** - a math concept where 20 people shake hands and we figure out that **18 people** shook hands exactly twice.

## The Problem

**20 people at a party**
- Everyone shakes hands
- Total count: 38
- Question: How many shook hands twice?
